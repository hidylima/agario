### Launching from a new server
Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
 - Get a fresh clone of the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/huytd/agar.io-clone
   ```
 - Install gulp globally (may require root privileges):
   ```
   npm install -g gulp
   ```
 - Install the application dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
 - Run the server:
   ```
   gulp run
   ```

Your server should be listening to port 3000 by default.  You can change any of the default parameters by editing the `server/config.yml` file.
